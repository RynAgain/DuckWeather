Starting development, shouldn't take long
- requests are not returned as a normal json, have to write code to reformat the data into the correct syntax.
- Began using the example files as a debugger, I'll have to rewrite them when im done.

- Code is working.  Established some basic class methods for updating the information 

- time stamps are in unix code, should probably include a method for converting that.

- Things I could add:
    - Convert to C, and K
    -
