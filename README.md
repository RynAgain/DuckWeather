# DuckWeather
 Python Package that web scrapes DuckDuckGo for free highly detailed weather data from any location. No API keys needed!


# Overview
This project creates a free simple way to get weather data with having to use an API service. 

# How to Use

## Installation
Copy the WetDuck.py into the same folder as your program.  Then import it as you would.

## Methods
Still building these out, examples can be found in the example workbook.

# DevLogs
### Method Todo List (data can be accessed the hard way already)
- Daily weather methods
- hourly weather methods
- check for rain in next 12 hrs
- check for next rain event
- error handling 
- more detailed location queries

### 11/4/2022
- added new methods
- converted the time, still needs some work.

### 11/3/2022

Starting development, shouldn't take long
- requests are not returned as a normal json, have to write code to reformat the data into the correct syntax.
- Began using the example files as a debugger, I'll have to rewrite them when im done.

- Code is working.  Established some basic class methods for updating the information 

- time stamps are in unix code, should probably include a method for converting that.

- Things I could add:
    - Redundant weather pull
    -
